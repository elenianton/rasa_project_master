Italian Cuisine. One of the oldest cuisines of the world is Italian. Everyone associates Italian cuisine with pizza, pasta and ice cream but in reality, Italian food is hugely variable, and something that probably isn’t so well known is that food in Italy is distinctively regional, with 20 regions. Wherever you might be though, you can usually expect an Italian meal to be structured as follows: Antipasto (appetizer), primo (rice or pasta), second (meat) and dolce (dessert). Famous for Parmesan cheese and Parma Ham, Italy actually produces more than 400 types of cheeses and 300 different types of sausages.
French Cuisine. Along with Italian, French was one of the first world cuisines that traveled well beyond its home country’s borders. Indeed, the modern restaurant has its roots in France and for many, many years, French food was thought of as haute cuisine. Many top chefs today still like to be classically French trained. French food ranges from rustic and hearty to the very finest, theatrical, almost art-like Michelin Star style and no French meal would be complete without bread, cheese and wine.
Greek Cuisine. The food of ancient Greece spread far across Europe and the near east, influencing many of the world cuisines we know today, and many modern Greek dishes are as old as the hills. There are also incoming influences from the lands the Greeks conquered and explored, so the lines between Greek, Turkish, Arabic and even Italian food are often blurred. Olive oil and fresh herbs are essential to producing the flavors so redolent of the Mediterranean and the Greek mezze is a wonderful way to experience the taste of Greece. Greece prefers lamb and pork to beef (many of the islands can’t support cattle), and of course fish and seafood have a heavy presence.
Indian Cuisine. It’s hard to sum up Indian cuisine because the massive country has many regional differences, with some parts strictly vegetarian. The overriding opinion is that Indian food is all curries but it isn’t really. Pinning it down to one major factor, the basis of Indian cuisine is highly complex spice blends designed for maximum flavor. As well as loving hot and spicy, Indians also have a very sweet palate and all special occasions are marked by piles of delicious sweet treats. There’s also a massive street food culture.
Mexican Cuisine. Again, there is a view of Mexican food that doesn’t do it justice and this is because of the way this has become one of the most popular world cuisines in recent years. The burritos, chimichangas, fajitas and chili con carne have been adopted by Western restaurants as Mexican food, but this only really represents Northern Mexico. The food of Central and South Mexico is subtler and more sophisticated, with many dishes having roots in the ancient Mayan culture. You will find tortillas all over the country, along with plenty of eggs and vegetables. Chilies, chocolate, tomatoes and cumin are major flavorings.
Chinese Cuisine. One of the most popular world cuisines – which town doesn’t have a Chinese restaurant or take away? – the Chinese cuisine has influenced the whole of South East Asia and permeated the western food consciousness. Another massive country, this is one cuisine where the regional diversity is classified into eight specific groups, being: Cantonese, Szechuan, Hunan, Zhejiang, Shandong, Anhui and Fujian. The characteristics of each food tradition are influenced by geography, climate and history, as well as lifestyle and wealth. Traditions in Chinese cuisine include the balance of opposites (ying and yang) and the four pillars of color, texture, aroma and taste.
